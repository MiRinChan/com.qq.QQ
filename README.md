## Features

### LiteLoaderQQNT

This is a third-party program which allows you load plugins to extend QQ and remove useless features as you need.

### Wayland

This package enables the flags to run on Wayland and it should work out-of-the-box.

This package also can fallback to X11 when Wayland is not available.

## Legality

The QQ app itself is **proprietary** (closed source).

This wrapper is not verified by, affiliated with, or supported by Tencent.
